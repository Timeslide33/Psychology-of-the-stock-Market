# The Panic and the Boom

Both the panic and the boom are eminently psychological phenomena.This is not saying that fundamental conditions do not at times warrant sharp declines in prices and at other times equally sharp advances. But the panic, properly socalled, represents a decline greater than is warranted by conditions, usually because of an excited state of the public mind, accompanied by exhaustion of resources; while the term "boom" is used to mean an excessive and largely speculative advance.

There are some special features connected with the panic and the boom which are worthy of separate consideration.

Tis is really astionishing what a holdthe fear of a possible panic has upon the minds of many investors. The menmory of the events of 1907 has undoubtedly operated greatly to lessen the volume of speculative trade from that time to the present (April, 1912).Panics of equal severity have occurred only a few times in the entire history of the country, and the possiblility of such anoutbreak in any one month is smaller than the chance of loss on the average investment through the failure of the company. Yet the specter of such a panic rises in the minds of the inexperienced whenever they think of buying stocks.

"Yes,"the investor may say,"Reading seems to be in a very strong position, but look where it sold in 1907--at $70 a share!"

It is sometimes assumed that the low prices in a panic are due to a sudden spasm of fear, which comes quickly and passes away quickly. This is not the case. In a way, the operation of the element of fear begins when prices are near the top. Some cautious investors begin to fear that the boom is being overdone and that a disastrous decline must follow the excessive speculation for the rise. They sell under the influence of this feeling.

During the ensuing decline, which may run for years, more and more people begin to fell uneasy over business or financial conditions, and they liquidate theirholdings. This caution or fearfulness gradually spreads, in creasing and decreasing in waves, but growing a little greater at each successive swell. The panic is not a sudden development, but is the result of causes long accumulated.

The actual bottom prices of the panic are more likely to result from necessity than from fear. Those investors whos could be frightened out of their holdings are likely to give up before the bottom is reached. The lowest prices are usually made by sales for those whose immediate resources are exhausted. Most of the are taken by surprise and could raise the money necessary to carry their stocks if they had a little time; but in the stock market,"time is the essence of the contract,"and is the very thing that they cannot have.

The great cause of loss in times of panic is the failure of the investor to keep enought of his capital in liquid form. He becomes"tied up" in various undertakings so that he cannot realize quickly. He may have abundant property,but no ready money. This condition, in turn, results from trying to do too much--greed, haste, excessive ambition, an oversupply of easy confidence as to the future.

It is noticeable in panic times that a period arrives when nearly every one thinks that stocks are low enough, yet prices conutnue downward to a still lower level. The result is that many investors, after thinking that they have "loaded up " near the bottom, find that it was a false bottom, and are finally forced to throw over their holdings on a further decline.

This is due to the fact mentioned above, that final low prices are the result of necessities, not of opinions. In 1907, for example, every one of good sense knew perfectly well that stocks were selling below their value--the trouble was that investors could not get hold of the money with which to buy.

The moral is that low prices, after a prolong ed bear period, are not in themselves a sufficient reason for buying stocks. The key to the situation lies in the *accumulation of liquid capital,*which is most quickly evidenced by a rapid recovery of the excess of deposits over loans in the New York clearing house banks(excluding the trust companies, in which loans are more varied). This subject, however, takes us outside our present field.

It is to a great extent because the last part of the decline in a panic has been caused not by public opinion, or even by public fear, but by necessity, arising from absolute exhaustion of available funds, that the first part of the ensuing recovery takes place without andy apparent reason.

Traders say, "The panic is over, but stocks cannot go up much under such bearish conditions as now exist." Yet stocks can and do go up, because they are merely regaining the natural level from which they were depressed by "bankrupt sales," as we would say in discussing dry goods.

Perhaps the word "fear" has been overworked in the discussion of stock market psychology. It is only the very few who actually sell their stocks under the direct in fluence of the emotion of fear. But afeeling of caution strong enought to induce sales, or even a fixed belief that prices must decline, constitutes in itself a sort of modification of fear, and has the same result so far as prices are concerned.

The effect of this fear or caution in a panic is not limited to the selling of stocks, but is even more important in preventing purchases. It takes far less uneasiness to cause the intending investor to delay purchases than to precipitate actual sales by holders. For this reason, a small quantiy of stock pressed for sale in a panicky market may cause a decline out of all proportion to its importance. The offerings may be small,bu nobody wants them.

It is this factor which accounts for the rapid recoveries which frequently follow panics. Waiting investors are afraid to steip in front of a demoralized market, byt once the turn appears, they fall over each other to buy.
